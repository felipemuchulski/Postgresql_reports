# Postgresql_reports
Hi everyone! This project deals with a configuration for printing reports of all databases based on PostgresSQL on your server.
  I'm creating this project because I had problems gettting what i needed, and creating this script solved my company's problems.
  This script serves the Devops part or if necessary print reports from all databases together in a single file.
  I'll explain the command lines and leave documentation for each command used.
  If there is something that can be improved, leave a comment for the changes and give ideas.
  Thanks!
